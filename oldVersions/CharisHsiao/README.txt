Open in Termial in directory TransE, then run commands in order to do LinkPredictation test on dataset WN18 as follow:
. make 
. sh train_WN18.sh
. sh test_WN18.sh

If you want to change parameters to train TransE model, just edit train_WN18.sh

With parameters recommanded by TransE, no correct test results will be gotten. Something wrong with those codes and I hava no idea for finding them out.
